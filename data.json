      Up until this year I had been living in France teaching English and before that I was a musician working on cruise ships.
       I have also spent quite a few years working in tech, in jobs that were not really that interesting. 
       I am here because I want to learn how to code and gain some practical skills which will help me begin a new and exciting career in tech. 
       I enjoy travelling, photography, meeting people and writing and playing music."
