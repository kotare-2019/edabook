      "bio": "I have worked for ten years in civil engineer in the field of water engineering. Most of my projects have focused on reducing the communities exposure to flood hazard, and improving the safety of infrastructure. In my career I have gained knowledge of specialised software tools to carry out this work, and now I have decided I need to understand how these tools are built, so I am undertaking study in Web Development at EDA Dev Academy. I want to understand how web technologies can be used to help the community and my colleagues carry out and communicate this work better. This will be needed as society faces increasing risk from these hazards due to climate change. "
